                        <h2>Map: Percentage of Individuals with Bachelor's Degree by Region</h2>
                        <p>This map shows the percentage of individuals holding a Bachelor’s degree across Australia’s regions in 2021. 
                            Notably, regions along the east coast, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, tend to have higher 
                            concentrations of degree holders, while inland and more remote areas show lower percentages. 
                            These regional differences reflect access to universities and urban-rural disparities in education.
                            Does the number of people holding degrees tell the full story about university success?</p>

                        <h2>Does Having a Degree Correlate With Institutional Performance?</h2>
                        <p>This line chart tracks the completion rates of students across major universities in Australia over time.
                            Interestingly, while many universities maintain a high and steady completion rate (above 80%), others, 
                            like Federation University Australia, show a noticeable drop in recent years. Institutions such as 
                            Monash University and The University of Melbourne consistently rank among the top performers with 
                            completion rates close to or above 90%. This raises the question of how institutional factors, 
                            such as resources and student support, influence success rates.</p>

                    <h2>Does Having a Degree Mean You're Employable?</h2>
                    <p>Understanding employment patterns is crucial for students when choosing their study areas, 
                        because it highlights the fields where full-time work is more readily available and how sectors like 
                        Education or Science may hold lower employability rates for full time work. For policymakers and 
                        universities, this visualisation emphasises that 73.6% of undergraduates receive at least a 
                        part time job when they complete their degrees</p>

                        <h2>Well What About the General Consensus?</h2>
                        <p> Looking at the heatmap below, It can be seen that higher education such as a Bachelor's or Postgraduate degree, significantly boosts 
                            employment prospects across all age groups, with employment rates climbing as high as 90% for postgraduates 
                            in the 25–34 age range.<br><br><br></p>

                        <h2>Does Studying Make you Earn More?</h2>
                        <p>While history shows that undergraduates have a higher median salary at the age of 21 compared to the national median,
                            the trend suggests that the advantage of those with a degree has decreased since 2016. 2016 boasts a 19.5% advantage for undergraduates,
                            2023 shows a 12.1% advantage. This may suggest an increase in salary for those without tertiary education.

                    <h2>What Do The Top Paying Jobs Say?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking at the bar chart below a key takeaway is that most of the top-paying roles, 
                        such as Psychiatrist and Engineering Manager, require a university degree. Interestingly, non-degree roles, 
                        like Site Supervisor, also appear in the top 20, demonstrating that some well-paying jobs don't always 
                        necessitate a formal degree.
                        <br>
                        While university degrees open doors to 
                        high-paying professions, skilled trades can still offer competitive salaries without the need for 
                        higher education. Having a degree boasts a naturally higher employment rate
